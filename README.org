* vacuum-packer

Plugin helper for [[https://github.com/EosFoundry/makeshift-ctrl][makeshift-ctrl]], it does four things and four things only:

1. Builds the package into a single file using [[https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/][rollup]]
2. Hashes the file and shoves it into manifest.json
3. Extracts function names from the entry point and dumps it into a manifest.json
4. Zips everything up
